                <div class="pl">
                    <p>In 1590 when King James VIs ship was caught in a storm thought to be caused by the work of
                        witches, witchcraft accusations increased around Scotland. While the King was starting to think
                        more negatively about witches, all around Scotland the church was spreading fear about the
                        devil. The fear of the devil extended to include people who were thought to be involved with the
                        devil, witches; people who were thought to have made a pact with the devil in order to get their
                        powers. This fear of the devil spread like wildfire around Scotland seeping into even the
                        smallest settlements, causing neighbors to look to each other in search of purging anyone
                        related to the devil. Accusation started with “the "neighborhood witch,"” who would be denounced
                        for causing harm to “community members, usually after quarrels that led to verbal abuse and
                        curses,” (Martin 7) or after a negative event in the settlement like the crops failing. People
                        like Isabel Young, who was a married mother with four sons and was of middling socioeconomic
                        status, was tried and executed for witchcraft in 1629. Like most people at the time her family
                        was deeply “intertwined” in the lives of other families in their town through “webs of debt,
                        renting, borrowing, and quarreling,” but unluckily for Isabel around “half” of the people in her
                        town, including the richest man, turned against her (Ring et al. 13). She was accused of
                        “conducting a protective magic ritual on her cattle in front of [her] barn,” (Ring et al. 13),
                        property damage (Ring et al. 14), and attempted murder of her husband (Ring et al. 15). There
                        were many accusations against other witches like the ones against Isabel, the most common types
                        of accusations were about Charming, Sorcery, Folk Healing, Neighborhood Dispute. Throughout our
                        sources, there were lots of examples of accused people like Isabel who were of middling or poor
                        socioeconomic status that were executed, in fact they were the majority. In contrast, it was
                        rare for a person of high socioeconomic status to be accused at all, and then executed. This is
                        one of the reasons that we wonder if socioeconomic status might have played a role in
                        accusations and trial outcomes along with other factors like bias. Our goal with this project is
                        to study the effects that socioeconomic status (e.g., class, occupation) of an individual and
                        bias had on witch accusations and trial outcomes (e.g., execution, banishment, released) in
                        1563-1736 Scotland. We ultimately want to learn how much status and bias played in the number of
                        accusations and the outcomes of trials for the accused witches. Our analysis uses the dataset
                        The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft by Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller, and Louise
                        Yeomen completed in 2003. This dataset contains hundreds of entries on accused witches and their
                        trials, listing important details such as socioeconomic status, occupation, and outcomes. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="pr">
                    <p>Overall, most of our sources supported the same theory: economic status of the area,
                        socioeconomic status of the accused, behavior of the accused, and occupation of the accused may
                        have affected the accusations, trials, and outcomes of the Scottish Witches. Many sources found
                        that when the weather was good, crop yields were high, and the economy was doing well, then the
                        number of people accused of being witches went down. But, when the weather was poor and the
                        economy was down, more people were accused of being witches because witches were thought to
                        control weather. (Oster) Additionally, witch hunting was encouraged by the church, because of
                        the fear of the devil and its relationship with witches. King James also encouraged witch
                        hunting because of his experiences with witches and their relationship with the devil. Both the
                        church and the King left most trial outcomes up to the local ministers, which allowed the
                        ministers personal beliefs and bias to affect the trials. It was found that most witches were
                        of poor or middling socioeconomic status and were having trouble with neighbors, arguments about
                        livestock, stress, etc., causing the ministers to not look favorably on the witches and leading
                        to worse outcomes. (Henderson) (Martin) The biggest contradiction we found in our sources was
                        related to weather: some of our sources suggested that good weather increased the number of
                        trials, because a better economy caused by better weather led to more money to pay for witch
                        trials (Oster). Other sources suggested the opposite, noting that a worse economy caused by
                        worse weather led to more hatred and thus to more witch trials (Cornelius). Both theories may
                        have some truth to them. Overall, all of our sources seem to agree that socioeconomic status and
                        similar characteristics, such as being a servant or midwife, could have affected accusations and
                        outcomes. Other scholars might agree or be neutral on this topic “because there has not yet been
                        much research” (Goodare, 292). This means that this theory has not been explored as much as it
                        has been mentioned or implied. While most of our sources confirmed or suggested our theory on
                        the Scottish Witchcraft Trials, we still have some more detailed questions they couldnt answer.
                        For example, does the socioeconomic status of the accused or other similar characteristics
                        actually affect the accusations and outcomes? Or, was some other factor in play that still needs
                        to be identified through studying the dataset? Why do most people focus on the supposed
                        connection between witches and the devil and not look at other characteristics? Because our
                        topic has not been researched deeply, we will need to investigate the dataset and other sources
                        to make these connections.</p>

                    <p>This project is important because it adds a socioeconomic perspective on the Scottish Witchcraft
                        trials which is a lens that has not been deeply explored yet. After diving into the literature
                        review, it became very apparent that the amount and level of research with this viewpoint is
                        scarce. As previously stated, the crop yield has been said to have affected the economy of
                        Scotland. According to a number of sources, when crops flourished, there were far less
                        accusations. This reasoning behind the accusation goes to show the bias involved within the
                        witchcraft trials. This project's goal is to help others understand the unjust motives and
                        reasoning when it comes to the accusation of particular witches whether that be occupation,
                        class, economic status of the area, or their personal behavior. Elements relating to the economy
                        of Scotland and the witches is one particular form of bias that we have explored in regards to
                        Witchcraft in Scotland. Socioeconomic impacts have not often been taken into account when
                        researching and understanding the accusations as well as the prosecution of Scottish Witches,
                        making this perspective unique. Furthermore, there is a larger idea connected to this viewpoint;
                        the correlation between a struggling economy and the increase of discrimination towards
                        particular groups of people.</p>

                <p>As shown in the timeline, the number of accused witches per year fluctuates drastically. There are
                    many reasons for the ups and downs. One being the crop yield of that particular year. Some
                    researchers hypothesize that there is a correlation between low crop yield and an increase in witch
                    accusations. This correlates with the theory that the economy has much to do with the bias involved
                    with the witch trials. Another reason for this variation is due to who was on power at the time. In
                    regards to witchcraft came a lot of religious bias. The leaders during the years had a lot of impact
                    on how harsh and abundant the accusations were each year. To be specific, Scottish Presbyterians
                    were substantially more active in persecuting alleged witches during periods when they were excluded
                    from power (Kulkarni, 1). This timeline allows you to see the drastic fluctuation from year to year
                    during the Scottish Witchcraft trials. </p>

                <p>It was made clear in our research that during this time period the majority of Scotland was poor,
                    relying heavily on successful agriculture harvests. This was also a time when people renting land
                    from Husbandmen (e.g. lesser landowners) as free tenants (e.g. cottars and grassmen) made up the
                    majority of the working population, and these landlords had considerable control over their tenants.
                    Additionally, Society in the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office.
                    Most people in this time relied on local production of their needs causing ties between populations
                    in a settlement to be strong through familiarity and debt. Once the fear of the devil and a witches
                    relationship with it spread throughout Scotland people in these settlements began to accuse
                    eachother of witchcraft, but whether these accusations were because the person was a “witch” or
                    because there was bias or grudge involved is what we are looking into. Through our sources and
                    looking through the dataset we have found that most accusations fall into a few similar categories:
                    Charming, Sorcery, Folk Healing, Neighborhood Dispute. </p>

                <h2>Examples of Witches</h2>
                <p>For most witches' accusations stacked up or time, their accusers could be anyone from their
                    settlement: neighbor, friend, family member. While the speed of this process might have changed
                    depending on the settlement and the years (like years of panic), in some places an accused person
                    might not have been tried as a witch until 2-10 years after the initial accusation. One reason
                    accusations were made slowly over time without action was because “local communities could live with
                    witches. People might use charms to protect themselves,” (Goodare, 298). Additionally, most
                    “witchcraft accusations grew out of decades of quarrels and curses between neighbors'' (Martin, 9).
                    Because most people who were accused “had little valuable property, and trials were costly,”
                    (Christian, 3), likely lack of money was a factor in causing accusations to stack up over time as
                    well. Lastly, it also was shown that outside of years of panic a witch “needed time to build up a
                    reputation,” (Goodare, 292). </p>

                    <h3>Socioeconomic Status of Accused Witches</h3>
                    <p>Overall, most witches were of middling or lower status, with very poor being the third highest
                        accused. The large difference between the amount of middling status people; 232, and nobility
                        status people; 4, is shocking. Especially because not every accused person in our dataset
                        included their socioeconomic status, its likely if every status of all accused persons was
                        known that difference would only grow. It was overall found that while most accused people were
                        of middling and lower status, making them “integral members of their local communities”, “high
                        status people either avoided denunciation or fought off charges at an early stage,” (Martin,
                        11). Additionally, it was possible that people were accused during times of economic problems
                        like with a famine, that “could not be tackled directly, witch-hunting was perhaps a
                        displacement activity,” to try to solve the problem a different way (Goodare, 293).
                        Additionally, womens behavior was also likely to get them accused of witchcraft because
                        “aggressive and insulting behavior was the kind of thing people expected from witches,”
                        (Goodare, 298). Furthermore, for people like Bessie Graham who practiced folk healing, their
                        business was turned “dangerous and illegitimate,” by the church because they “regarded it as
                        "superstitious",” (Goodare, 303). Suddenly, their settlement who benefited from their business
                        turned against them and got tried for witchcraft. Altogether, it is apparent that witch
                        accusations were affected by factors such as status, occupation, and bias, making the accusation
                        more than just about hunting witches.</p>

                    <p>This visualization is helpful to show the correlation between certain words like “servant”,
                        “middling”, and “very poor” with words like “executed” and “guilty”. This thicker the line, the
                        more relation the words have. This shows that your particular occupation or status has much to
                        do with how you are prosecuted. It is clear through this analysis that socioeconomic
                        characteristics do have a relationship with the result of the accusation and prosecution.</p>
