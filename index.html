            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p>Our goal with this project is to study the effects that socioeconomic status (e.g., class, occupation) of an individual had on witch accusations and trial outcomes (e.g., execution, banishment, released) in 1563-1736 Scotland. We ultimately want to learn how much status played in the number of accusations and the outcomes of trials for the accused witches. Our analysis uses the dataset The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft by Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller, and Louise Yeomen completed in 2003. This dataset contains hundreds of entries on accused witches and their trials, listing important details such as socioeconomic status, occupation, and outcomes. This project is important because it adds a socioeconomic perspective on the Scottish Witchcraft trials which is a lens that has not been deeply explored yet. After diving into the literature review, it became very apparent that the amount and level of research with this viewpoint is scarce. Socioeconomic impacts have not often been taken into account when researching and understanding the accusations as well as the prosecution of Scottish Witches, making this perspective unique. Furthermore, there is a larger idea connected to this viewpoint; the correlation between a struggling economy and the increase of discrimination towards particular groups of people. The goal of this project is to help others understand the impact of socioeconomic status on the accusation and prosecution of the Scottish Witches.<br> 
                Overall, most of our sources supported the same theory: economic status of the area, socioeconomic status of the accused, behavior of the accused, and occupation of the accused may have affected the accusations, trials, and outcomes of the Scottish Witches. Many sources found that when the weather was good, crop yields were high, and the economy was doing well, then the number of people accused of being witches went down. But, when the weather was poor and the economy was down, more people were accused of being witches because witches were thought to control weather. Additionally, witch hunting was encouraged by the church, because of the fear of the devil and its relationship with witches. King James also encouraged witch hunting because of his experiences with witches and their relationship with the devil. Both the church and the King left most trial outcomes up to the local ministers, which allowed the minister’s personal beliefs and bias to affect the trials. It was found that most witches were of poor or middling socioeconomic status and were having trouble with neighbors, arguments about livestock, stress, etc., causing the ministers to not look favorably on the witches and leading to worse outcomes. The biggest contradiction we found in our sources was related to weather: some of our sources suggested that good weather increased the number of trials, because a better economy–caused by better weather–led to more money to pay for witch trials. Other sources suggested the opposite, noting that a worse economy caused by worse weather led to more hatred and thus to more witch trials. Both theories may have some truth to them. Overall, all our sources seem to agree that socioeconomic status and similar characteristics, such as being a servant or midwife, could have affected accusations and outcomes. Other scholars might agree or be neutral on this topic “because there has not yet been much research” (Goodare, 292). This means that this theory has not been explored as much as it has been mentioned or implied. While most of our sources confirmed or suggested our theory on the Scottish Witchcraft Trials, we still have some more detailed questions they couldn’t answer. For example, does the socioeconomic status of the accused or other similar characteristics actually affect the accusations and outcomes? Or, was some other factor in play that still needs to be identified through studying the dataset? Why do most people focus on the supposed connection between witches and the devil and not look at other characteristics? Because our topic has not been researched deeply, we will need to investigate the dataset and other sources to make these connections.<br> 
                Witchcraft accusations increased in Scotland in 1590, when King James VI’s ship was caught in a storm thought to be caused by the work of witches. (paint the picture here) (background of the time) An example listed in the compiled paper by N. Ring was Bessie Dunlop (1576), who was of a very poor to middling socioeconomic status and was executed. (more info on Bessie to help paint the picture more) There were lots of examples of accused people like Bessie found throughout our sources who were of poor or middling socioeconomic status that were executed, in fact they were the majority. In contrast, it was rare for a person of high socioeconomic status to be accused, and then executed. This is one of the reasons that we wonder if socioeconomic status might have played a role in accusations and trial outcomes. </p>
