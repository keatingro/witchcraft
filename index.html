                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <div class="pl"><p>In 1590 when King James VI’s ship was caught in a storm thought to be caused by the work of witches, witchcraft accusations increased around Scotland. While the King was starting to think more negatively about witches, all around Scotland the church was spreading fear about the devil. The fear of the devil extended to include people who were thought to be involved with the devil, witches; people who were thought to have made a pact with the devil in order to get their powers. This fear of the devil spread like wildfire around Scotland seeping into even the smallest settlements, causing neighbors to look to each other in search of purging anyone related to the devil. Accusation started with “the ‘neighborhood witch,’” who would be denounced for causing harm to “community members, usually after quarrels that led to verbal abuse and curses,” (Martin 7) or after a negative event in the settlement like the crops failing. People like Isabel Young, who was a married mother with four sons and was of middling socioeconomic status, was tried and executed for witchcraft in 1629. Like most people at the time her family was deeply “intertwined” in the lives of other families in their town through “webs of debt, renting, borrowing, and quarreling,” but unluckily for Isabel around “half” of the people in her town, including the richest man, turned against her (Ring et al. 13). She was accused of “conducting a protective magic ritual on her cattle in front of [her] barn,” (Ring et al. 13), property damage (Ring et al. 14), and attempted murder of her husband (Ring et al. 15). There were many accusations against other witches like the ones against Isabel, the most common types of accusations were about Charming, Sorcery, Folk Healing, Neighborhood Dispute. Throughout our sources, there were lots of examples of accused people like Isabel who were of middling or poor socioeconomic status that were executed, in fact they were the majority. In contrast, it was rare for a person of high socioeconomic status to be accused at all, and then executed. This is one of the reasons that we wonder if socioeconomic status might have played a role in accusations and trial outcomes along with other factors like bias. Our goal with this project is to study the effects that socioeconomic status (e.g., class, occupation) of an individual and bias had on witch accusations and trial outcomes (e.g., execution, banishment, released) in 1563-1736 Scotland. We ultimately want to learn how much status and bias played in the number of accusations and the outcomes of trials for the accused witches. Our analysis uses the dataset The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft by Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller, and Louise Yeomen completed in 2003. This dataset contains hundreds of entries on accused witches and their trials, listing important details such as socioeconomic status, occupation, and outcomes. </p></div>
                <div class="pr"><p>Overall, most of our sources supported the same theory: economic status of the area, socioeconomic status of the accused, behavior of the accused, and occupation of the accused may have affected the accusations, trials, and outcomes of the Scottish Witches. Many sources found that when the weather was good, crop yields were high, and the economy was doing well, then the number of people accused of being witches went down. But, when the weather was poor and the economy was down, more people were accused of being witches because witches were thought to control weather. (Oster) Additionally, witch hunting was encouraged by the church, because of the fear of the devil and its relationship with witches. King James also encouraged witch hunting because of his experiences with witches and their relationship with the devil. Both the church and the King left most trial outcomes up to the local ministers, which allowed the minister’s personal beliefs and bias to affect the trials. It was found that most witches were of poor or middling socioeconomic status and were having trouble with neighbors, arguments about livestock, stress, etc., causing the ministers to not look favorably on the witches and leading to worse outcomes. (Henderson) (Martin) The biggest contradiction we found in our sources was related to weather: some of our sources suggested that good weather increased the number of trials, because a better economy–caused by better weather–led to more money to pay for witch trials (Oster). Other sources suggested the opposite, noting that a worse economy caused by worse weather led to more hatred and thus to more witch trials (Cornelius). Both theories may have some truth to them. Overall, all of our sources seem to agree that socioeconomic status and similar characteristics, such as being a servant or midwife, could have affected accusations and outcomes. Other scholars might agree or be neutral on this topic “because there has not yet been much research” (Goodare, 292). This means that this theory has not been explored as much as it has been mentioned or implied. While most of our sources confirmed or suggested our theory on the Scottish Witchcraft Trials, we still have some more detailed questions they couldn’t answer. For example, does the socioeconomic status of the accused or other similar characteristics actually affect the accusations and outcomes? Or, was some other factor in play that still needs to be identified through studying the dataset? Why do most people focus on the supposed connection between witches and the devil and not look at other characteristics? Because our topic has not been researched deeply, we will need to investigate the dataset and other sources to make these connections.</p></div>
                <div class="clearfix"></div><div class="pm"><p>This project is important because it adds a socioeconomic perspective on the Scottish Witchcraft trials which is a lens that has not been deeply explored yet. After diving into the literature review, it became very apparent that the amount and level of research with this viewpoint is scarce. As previously stated, the crop yield has been said to have affected the economy of Scotland. According to a number of sources, when crops flourished, there were far less accusations. This reasoning behind the accusation goes to show the bias involved within the witchcraft trials. This project's goal is to help others understand the unjust motives and reasoning when it comes to the accusation of particular witches whether that be occupation, class, economic status of the area, or their personal behavior. Elements relating to the economy of Scotland and the witches is one particular form of bias that we have explored in regards to Witchcraft in Scotland. Socioeconomic impacts have not often been taken into account when researching and understanding the accusations as well as the prosecution of Scottish Witches, making this perspective unique. Furthermore, there is a larger idea connected to this viewpoint; the correlation between a struggling economy and the increase of discrimination towards particular groups of people.</p></div>

            <div class="pm"><p>As shown in the timeline, the number of accused witches per year fluctuates drastically. There are many reasons for the ups and downs. One being the crop yield of that particular year. Some researchers hypothesize that there is a correlation between low crop yield and an increase in witch accusations. This correlates with the theory that the economy has much to do with the bias involved with the witch trials. Another reason for this variation is due to who was on power at the time. In regards to witchcraft came a lot of religious bias. The leaders during the years had a lot of impact on how harsh and abundant the accusations were each year. To be specific, Scottish Presbyterians were substantially more active in persecuting alleged witches during periods when they were excluded from power (Kulkarni, 1). This timeline allows you to see the drastic fluctuation from year to year during the Scottish Witchcraft trials. </p></div>
